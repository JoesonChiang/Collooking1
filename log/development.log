When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the cheese, if using (I sometimes grate mine directly on to the omelette).

If you only have one pan, simply prepare the scramble eggs first.\n Step 2: To prepare the scrambled eggs, first, crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork to beat until the yolks and egg whites are well mixed.\n Step 3: Coat a frying pan with one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil & heat on medium to low heat.\n Step 4: Pour the egg mixture into the pan and allow the eggs to cook, stirring with a spatula occasionally. Once finished, remove from heat.\n Step 5: To prepare the queadilla itself, oil a frying pan and heat on medium-low heat. The pan used for the eggs will work fine, but first remove the eggs (put them on your plate or in bowl temporarily) and clean off any unsightly egg-debris left in the pan.\n Step 6: Now, lay one tortilla down in the frying pan and cover it with a small handful of shredded cheese (about 2 oz.); spread the cheese out evenly across the tortilla for even distribution. While on the heat, continually check to see how the tortilla is cooking every 1-2 minutes. The goals here are to achieve a golden brown tortilla & to melt the cheese; reduce heat as needed to prevent the tortilla from burning.\n Step 7: Using a spoon or fork, spread your scrambled eggs onto the tortilla. Now is also the time to add hot sauce or any other seasoning/sauces.\n Step 8: Next, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and place the second tortilla on top of it all. Use a fork or spatula to gently press down & seal the quesdilla's edges, to prevent cheese and egg from oozing out.\n Step 9: Once the initial tortilla has sufficiently browned and the cheese has began to melt, use a spatula to carefully flip the entire quesadilla to allow for the other side to cook. The flip can be a challenge with a over-loaded quesadilla. A simple solution to this problem is to first flip the quesadilla onto a plate, and then slide it back into the frying pan onto its uncooked side.\n Step 10: Cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the second tortilla has also browned and become adequately crisp.\n Step 11: Turn off burner heat, plate and let cool for about 3 minutes.

For a browner crust, lightly apply a layer of light olive oil to the bread prior to baking.\n Step 8: Once lightly browned, remove the bread from the oven and scoop the tomato mixture on top of each slice of bread.\n Step 9: Serve immediately in order to keep the delicious crispiness.

If you only have one pan, simply prepare the scramble eggs first.</p> Step 2: To prepare the scrambled eggs, first, crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork to beat until the yolks and egg whites are well mixed.</p> Step 3: Coat a frying pan with one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil & heat on medium to low heat.</p> Step 4: Pour the egg mixture into the pan and allow the eggs to cook, stirring with a spatula occasionally. Once finished, remove from heat.</p> Step 5: To prepare the queadilla itself, oil a frying pan and heat on medium-low heat. The pan used for the eggs will work fine, but first remove the eggs (put them on your plate or in bowl temporarily) and clean off any unsightly egg-debris left in the pan.</p> Step 6: Now, lay one tortilla down in the frying pan and cover it with a small handful of shredded cheese (about 2 oz.); spread the cheese out evenly across the tortilla for even distribution. While on the heat, continually check to see how the tortilla is cooking every 1-2 minutes. The goals here are to achieve a golden brown tortilla & to melt the cheese; reduce heat as needed to prevent the tortilla from burning.</p> Step 7: Using a spoon or fork, spread your scrambled eggs onto the tortilla. Now is also the time to add hot sauce or any other seasoning/sauces.</p> Step 8: Next, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and place the second tortilla on top of it all. Use a fork or spatula to gently press down & seal the quesdilla's edges, to prevent cheese and egg from oozing out.</p> Step 9: Once the initial tortilla has sufficiently browned and the cheese has began to melt, use a spatula to carefully flip the entire quesadilla to allow for the other side to cook. The flip can be a challenge with a over-loaded quesadilla. A simple solution to this problem is to first flip the quesadilla onto a plate, and then slide it back into the frying pan onto its uncooked side.</p> Step 10: Cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the second tortilla has also browned and become adequately crisp.</p> Step 11: Turn off burner heat, plate and let cool for about 3 minutes.

If you only have one pan, simply prepare the scramble eggs first.<br /> Step 2: To prepare the scrambled eggs, first, crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork to beat until the yolks and egg whites are well mixed.<br /> Step 3: Coat a frying pan with one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil & heat on medium to low heat.<br /> Step 4: Pour the egg mixture into the pan and allow the eggs to cook, stirring with a spatula occasionally. Once finished, remove from heat.<br /> Step 5: To prepare the queadilla itself, oil a frying pan and heat on medium-low heat. The pan used for the eggs will work fine, but first remove the eggs (put them on your plate or in bowl temporarily) and clean off any unsightly egg-debris left in the pan.<br /> Step 6: Now, lay one tortilla down in the frying pan and cover it with a small handful of shredded cheese (about 2 oz.); spread the cheese out evenly across the tortilla for even distribution. While on the heat, continually check to see how the tortilla is cooking every 1-2 minutes. The goals here are to achieve a golden brown tortilla & to melt the cheese; reduce heat as needed to prevent the tortilla from burning.<br /> Step 7: Using a spoon or fork, spread your scrambled eggs onto the tortilla. Now is also the time to add hot sauce or any other seasoning/sauces.<br /> Step 8: Next, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and place the second tortilla on top of it all. Use a fork or spatula to gently press down & seal the quesdilla's edges, to prevent cheese and egg from oozing out.<br /> Step 9: Once the initial tortilla has sufficiently browned and the cheese has began to melt, use a spatula to carefully flip the entire quesadilla to allow for the other side to cook. The flip can be a challenge with a over-loaded quesadilla. A simple solution to this problem is to first flip the quesadilla onto a plate, and then slide it back into the frying pan onto its uncooked side.<br /> Step 10: Cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the second tortilla has also browned and become adequately crisp.<br /> Step 11: Turn off burner heat, plate and let cool for about 3 minutes.

Shredded Cheese (Mexican, Mozzarella, etc.) \n 1-2 tbsp. Cooking Oil"], ["instructions", "Step 1: If you have two pans and are up for a challenge, you can begin preparing the quesadilla and scrambled eggs simultaneously. If you only have one pan, simply prepare the scramble eggs first.\n Step 2: To prepare the scrambled eggs, first, crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork to beat until the yolks and egg whites are well mixed.\n Step 3: Coat a frying pan with one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil & heat on medium to low heat.\n Step 4: Pour the egg mixture into the pan and allow the eggs to cook, stirring with a spatula occasionally. Once finished, remove from heat.\n Step 5: To prepare the queadilla itself, oil a frying pan and heat on medium-low heat. The pan used for the eggs will work fine, but first remove the eggs (put them on your plate or in bowl temporarily) and clean off any unsightly egg-debris left in the pan.\n Step 6: Now, lay one tortilla down in the frying pan and cover it with a small handful of shredded cheese (about 2 oz.); spread the cheese out evenly across the tortilla for even distribution. While on the heat, continually check to see how the tortilla is cooking every 1-2 minutes. The goals here are to achieve a golden brown tortilla & to melt the cheese; reduce heat as needed to prevent the tortilla from burning.\n Step 7: Using a spoon or fork, spread your scrambled eggs onto the tortilla. Now is also the time to add hot sauce or any other seasoning/sauces.\n Step 8: Next, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and place the second tortilla on top of it all. Use a fork or spatula to gently press down & seal the quesdilla's edges, to prevent cheese and egg from oozing out.\n Step 9: Once the initial tortilla has sufficiently browned and the cheese has began to melt, use a spatula to carefully flip the entire quesadilla to allow for the other side to cook. The flip can be a challenge with a over-loaded quesadilla. A simple solution to this problem is to first flip the quesadilla onto a plate, and then slide it back into the frying pan onto its uncooked side.\n Step 10: Cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the second tortilla has also browned and become adequately crisp.\n Step 11: Turn off burner heat, plate and let cool for about 3 minutes.

Ground beef (or preformed burger patties) \n 2 strips Bacon \n 1 slice Cheddar Cheese \n 2 tbs. Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing (the type that comes in a jar preferably - either works) \n 1 tbs.

After washing your hands, wear gloves if you wish, form 4 oz balls of hamburger and then squish them into patty form. Thinner patties mean faster-cooking-patties. Depending on how lean your meat is, your burgers will shrink as grease is released - account for this when forming your patties.\n Step 3: Heat your stove-top to medium-high heat; if using a gas stove, achieve a medium flame. Allow the pan to momentarily preheat then place your patties in the pan.\n Step 4: Using a spatula or other flipping utensil, test the patties' firmness by attempting to get under the patty with the utinzel. If the meat is too raw, attempting to flip it will make the patty crumble. Once firm, flip the patties.\n Step 5: Now, add the bacon to the center of the pan. Flip it occasionally and cook it to your desired level of crispiness.\n Step 6: As always, cook your meat thoroughly until it is firm and no longer pink.\n Step 7: Once the burgers appear done, turn your burner off and place the meat on a plate for momentary storage.\n Step 8: Apply your BBQ sauce to the bottom bun-half and place one of the patties on the bun.\n Step 9: Next, place the Cheddar cheese on this patty and stack the second patty on top.\n Step 10: Finally, using a spoon, drizzle Blue Cheese atop the top burger and apply the top bun-half!\n Step 11: Tip: This will be a messy one. Try stabbing a toothpick or shish kabob stick through the middle of the burger to hold the ingredients in place. Or, secure the entirety of the burger in your hand with a paper towel and eat it like that. If it the tower falls, use a fork (or your hands) and eat it piece by piece."], ["level", 5], ["name", "Bacon BBQ Blue Burger"], ["updated_at", "2014-12-04 19:46:56.625346"]]

If you only have one pan, simply prepare the scramble eggs first.\n Step 2: To prepare the scrambled eggs, first, crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork to beat until the yolks and egg whites are well mixed.\n Step 3: Coat a frying pan with one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil & heat on medium to low heat.\n Step 4: Pour the egg mixture into the pan and allow the eggs to cook, stirring with a spatula occasionally. Once finished, remove from heat.\n Step 5: To prepare the queadilla itself, oil a frying pan and heat on medium-low heat. The pan used for the eggs will work fine, but first remove the eggs (put them on your plate or in bowl temporarily) and clean off any unsightly egg-debris left in the pan.\n Step 6: Now, lay one tortilla down in the frying pan and cover it with a small handful of shredded cheese (about 2 oz.); spread the cheese out evenly across the tortilla for even distribution. While on the heat, continually check to see how the tortilla is cooking every 1-2 minutes. The goals here are to achieve a golden brown tortilla & to melt the cheese; reduce heat as needed to prevent the tortilla from burning.\n Step 7: Using a spoon or fork, spread your scrambled eggs onto the tortilla. Now is also the time to add hot sauce or any other seasoning/sauces.\n Step 8: Next, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and place the second tortilla on top of it all. Use a fork or spatula to gently press down & seal the quesdilla's edges, to prevent cheese and egg from oozing out.\n Step 9: Once the initial tortilla has sufficiently browned and the cheese has began to melt, use a spatula to carefully flip the entire quesadilla to allow for the other side to cook. The flip can be a challenge with a over-loaded quesadilla. A simple solution to this problem is to first flip the quesadilla onto a plate, and then slide it back into the frying pan onto its uncooked side.\n Step 10: Cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the second tortilla has also browned and become adequately crisp.\n Step 11: Turn off burner heat, plate and let cool for about 3 minutes.

After washing your hands, wear gloves if you wish, form 4 oz balls of hamburger and then squish them into patty form. Thinner patties mean faster-cooking-patties. Depending on how lean your meat is, your burgers will shrink as grease is released - account for this when forming your patties.\n Step 3: Heat your stove-top to medium-high heat; if using a gas stove, achieve a medium flame. Allow the pan to momentarily preheat then place your patties in the pan.\n Step 4: Using a spatula or other flipping utensil, test the patties' firmness by attempting to get under the patty with the utinzel. If the meat is too raw, attempting to flip it will make the patty crumble. Once firm, flip the patties.\n Step 5: Now, add the bacon to the center of the pan. Flip it occasionally and cook it to your desired level of crispiness.\n Step 6: As always, cook your meat thoroughly until it is firm and no longer pink.\n Step 7: Once the burgers appear done, turn your burner off and place the meat on a plate for momentary storage.\n Step 8: Apply your BBQ sauce to the bottom bun-half and place one of the patties on the bun.\n Step 9: Next, place the Cheddar cheese on this patty and stack the second patty on top.\n Step 10: Finally, using a spoon, drizzle Blue Cheese atop the top burger and apply the top bun-half!\n Step 11: Tip: This will be a messy one. Try stabbing a toothpick or shish kabob stick through the middle of the burger to hold the ingredients in place. Or, secure the entirety of the burger in your hand with a paper towel and eat it like that. If it the tower falls, use a fork (or your hands) and eat it piece by piece."], ["level", 5], ["name", "Bacon BBQ Blue Burger"], ["updated_at", "2014-12-05 01:22:04.473662"]]

If you only have one pan, simply prepare the scramble eggs first.\n Step 2: To prepare the scrambled eggs, first, crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork to beat until the yolks and egg whites are well mixed.\n Step 3: Coat a frying pan with one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil & heat on medium to low heat.\n Step 4: Pour the egg mixture into the pan and allow the eggs to cook, stirring with a spatula occasionally. Once finished, remove from heat.\n Step 5: To prepare the queadilla itself, oil a frying pan and heat on medium-low heat. The pan used for the eggs will work fine, but first remove the eggs (put them on your plate or in bowl temporarily) and clean off any unsightly egg-debris left in the pan.\n Step 6: Now, lay one tortilla down in the frying pan and cover it with a small handful of shredded cheese (about 2 oz.); spread the cheese out evenly across the tortilla for even distribution. While on the heat, continually check to see how the tortilla is cooking every 1-2 minutes. The goals here are to achieve a golden brown tortilla & to melt the cheese; reduce heat as needed to prevent the tortilla from burning.\n Step 7: Using a spoon or fork, spread your scrambled eggs onto the tortilla. Now is also the time to add hot sauce or any other seasoning/sauces.\n Step 8: Next, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and place the second tortilla on top of it all. Use a fork or spatula to gently press down & seal the quesdilla's edges, to prevent cheese and egg from oozing out.\n Step 9: Once the initial tortilla has sufficiently browned and the cheese has began to melt, use a spatula to carefully flip the entire quesadilla to allow for the other side to cook. The flip can be a challenge with a over-loaded quesadilla. A simple solution to this problem is to first flip the quesadilla onto a plate, and then slide it back into the frying pan onto its uncooked side.\n Step 10: Cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the second tortilla has also browned and become adequately crisp.\n Step 11: Turn off burner heat, plate and let cool for about 3 minutes.

This meal comes together in under 10 minutes, and is sure to be a great start to any day."], ["ingredients", "2 Flour Tortillas \n 2 Eggs \n 4 oz. Shredded Cheese (Mexican, Mozzarella, etc.) \n 1-2 tbsp. Cooking Oil"], ["instructions", "Step 1: If you have two pans and are up for a challenge, you can begin preparing the quesadilla and scrambled eggs simultaneously. If you only have one pan, simply prepare the scramble eggs first.\n Step 2: To prepare the scrambled eggs, first, crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork to beat until the yolks and egg whites are well mixed.\n Step 3: Coat a frying pan with one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil & heat on medium to low heat.\n Step 4: Pour the egg mixture into the pan and allow the eggs to cook, stirring with a spatula occasionally. Once finished, remove from heat.\n Step 5: To prepare the queadilla itself, oil a frying pan and heat on medium-low heat. The pan used for the eggs will work fine, but first remove the eggs (put them on your plate or in bowl temporarily) and clean off any unsightly egg-debris left in the pan.\n Step 6: Now, lay one tortilla down in the frying pan and cover it with a small handful of shredded cheese (about 2 oz.); spread the cheese out evenly across the tortilla for even distribution. While on the heat, continually check to see how the tortilla is cooking every 1-2 minutes. The goals here are to achieve a golden brown tortilla & to melt the cheese; reduce heat as needed to prevent the tortilla from burning.\n Step 7: Using a spoon or fork, spread your scrambled eggs onto the tortilla. Now is also the time to add hot sauce or any other seasoning/sauces.\n Step 8: Next, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and place the second tortilla on top of it all. Use a fork or spatula to gently press down & seal the quesdilla's edges, to prevent cheese and egg from oozing out.\n Step 9: Once the initial tortilla has sufficiently browned and the cheese has began to melt, use a spatula to carefully flip the entire quesadilla to allow for the other side to cook.

After washing your hands, wear gloves if you wish, form 4 oz balls of hamburger and then squish them into patty form. Thinner patties mean faster-cooking-patties. Depending on how lean your meat is, your burgers will shrink as grease is released - account for this when forming your patties.\n Step 3: Heat your stove-top to medium-high heat; if using a gas stove, achieve a medium flame. Allow the pan to momentarily preheat then place your patties in the pan.\n Step 4: Using a spatula or other flipping utensil, test the patties' firmness by attempting to get under the patty with the utinzel. If the meat is too raw, attempting to flip it will make the patty crumble. Once firm, flip the patties.\n Step 5: Now, add the bacon to the center of the pan. Flip it occasionally and cook it to your desired level of crispiness.\n Step 6: As always, cook your meat thoroughly until it is firm and no longer pink.\n Step 7: Once the burgers appear done, turn your burner off and place the meat on a plate for momentary storage.\n Step 8: Apply your BBQ sauce to the bottom bun-half and place one of the patties on the bun.\n Step 9: Next, place the Cheddar cheese on this patty and stack the second patty on top.\n Step 10: Finally, using a spoon, drizzle Blue Cheese atop the top burger and apply the top bun-half!\n Step 11: Tip: This will be a messy one. Try stabbing a toothpick or shish kabob stick through the middle of the burger to hold the ingredients in place. Or, secure the entirety of the burger in your hand with a paper towel and eat it like that. If it the tower falls, use a fork (or your hands) and eat it piece by piece."], ["level", 5], ["name", "Bacon BBQ Blue Burger"], ["updated_at", "2014-12-05 01:43:47.018537"]]
