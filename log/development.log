Step 3: When the butter has melted and is bubbling, add your eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly. When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the cheese, if using (I sometimes grate mine directly on to the omelette). Step 4: Using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in half.
