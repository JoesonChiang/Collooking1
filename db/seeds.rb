Recipe.create name: 'Simple Omelette', level: '1', description: "Omelettes are tasty and super-quick to knock together. A simple omelette is delicious, but if you like to mix things up, some of the other flavour combinations I've given you below are really good, whether you're eating your omelette for breakfast, lunch, or even dinner on those nights when you don't want to be in the kitchen for long.", instructions: "Step 1: Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper. Beat well with a fork. \nStep 2: Put a small frying pan on a low heat and let it get hot. Add a small knob of butter. \nStep 3: When the butter has melted and is bubbling, add your eggs and move the pan around to spread them out evenly. When the omelette begins to cook and firm up, but still has a little raw egg on top, sprinkle over the cheese, if using (I sometimes grate mine directly on to the omelette). \nStep 4: Using a spatula, ease around the edges of the omelette, then fold it over in half. When it starts to turn golden brown underneath, remove the pan from the heat and slide the omelette on to a plate."

If you are a chocolate lover, I recommend putting a piece of chocolate on each graham cracker half, and the topping each with a marshmallow. \n Step 3: Microwave on high for 10-20 seconds while watching, in 5 second increments. Most microwaves will not require the full 20 seconds; remove it once the chocolate has softened, but before the marshmallow grows too large and explodes.\n Step 4: Remove from microwave and carefully flip one half onto the other, to close the sandwich with the marshmallow and chocolate between the graham crackers.\n Step 5: After creating sandwich, let sit a minute or two, allowing the marshmallow to settle and the chocolate to continue melting.\n Step 6: Carefully hold over a plate while eating (it’s messy) and enjoy!"

Mustard" , instructions: "Step 1: First, cook your bacon. You'll want it slightly less done than you normally prefer. If you have an oven or toaster oven, we recommend baking your bacon \n Step 2: While your bacon cooks, use a spoon to mix together the Brown Sugar and Mustard. The Mustard is here to help liquefy the Brown Sugar and prevent it from burning during the next step. The mixture should be pour-able. Depending on your mustard, a dash or two of water may be needed as well. \n Step 3: Now, place the cooked bacon into a frying pan over LOW heat. Drizzle the brown sugar mixture over the bacon. If the heat is too high, the brown sugar will burn. Use a spatula to ensure that all of the bacon is covered by the mixture. \n Step 4: Stir the bacon occasionally while cooking for 3-5 minutes. \n Step 5: After the sugar appears caramelized on each piece of bacon (it will appear sticky and glossy), carefully remove the bacon from the pan and place it onto a serving tray so that strips are not touching (they'll stick together). \n Step 6: Eat it hot or refrigerate and eat it cold later.

Shredded Cheese (Mexican, Mozzarella, etc.) \n 1-2 tbsp. Cooking Oil", instructions: "Step 1: If you have two pans and are up for a challenge, you can begin preparing the quesadilla and scrambled eggs simultaneously. If you only have one pan, simply prepare the scramble eggs first.\n Step 2: To prepare the scrambled eggs, first, crack the eggs into a bowl and use a fork to beat until the yolks and egg whites are well mixed.\n Step 3: Coat a frying pan with one to two tablespoons of vegetable oil & heat on medium to low heat.\n Step 4: Pour the egg mixture into the pan and allow the eggs to cook, stirring with a spatula occasionally. Once finished, remove from heat.\n Step 5: To prepare the queadilla itself, oil a frying pan and heat on medium-low heat. The pan used for the eggs will work fine, but first remove the eggs (put them on your plate or in bowl temporarily) and clean off any unsightly egg-debris left in the pan.\n Step 6: Now, lay one tortilla down in the frying pan and cover it with a small handful of shredded cheese (about 2 oz.); spread the cheese out evenly across the tortilla for even distribution. While on the heat, continually check to see how the tortilla is cooking every 1-2 minutes. The goals here are to achieve a golden brown tortilla & to melt the cheese; reduce heat as needed to prevent the tortilla from burning.\n Step 7: Using a spoon or fork, spread your scrambled eggs onto the tortilla. Now is also the time to add hot sauce or any other seasoning/sauces.\n Step 8: Next, sprinkle on the rest of the cheese and place the second tortilla on top of it all. Use a fork or spatula to gently press down & seal the quesdilla's edges, to prevent cheese and egg from oozing out.\n Step 9: Once the initial tortilla has sufficiently browned and the cheese has began to melt, use a spatula to carefully flip the entire quesadilla to allow for the other side to cook. The flip can be a challenge with a over-loaded quesadilla. A simple solution to this problem is to first flip the quesadilla onto a plate, and then slide it back into the frying pan onto its uncooked side.\n Step 10: Cook for 2-3 more minutes, until the second tortilla has also browned and become adequately crisp.\n Step 11: Turn off burner heat, plate and let cool for about 3 minutes. Cut into manageable pieces and enjoy your delicious breakfast!"

After washing your hands, wear gloves if you wish, form 4 oz balls of hamburger and then squish them into patty form. Thinner patties mean faster-cooking-patties.

Allow the pan to momentarily preheat then place your patties in the pan.\n Step 4: Using a spatula or other flipping utensil, test the patties' firmness by attempting to get under the patty with the utinzel. If the meat is too raw, attempting to flip it will make the patty crumble. Once firm, flip the patties.\n Step 5: Now, add the bacon to the center of the pan. Flip it occasionally and cook it to your desired level of crispiness.\n Step 6: As always, cook your meat thoroughly until it is firm and no longer pink.\n Step 7: Once the burgers appear done, turn your burner off and place the meat on a plate for momentary storage.\n Step 8: Apply your BBQ sauce to the bottom bun-half and place one of the patties on the bun.\n Step 9: Next, place the Cheddar cheese on this patty and stack the second patty on top.\n Step 10: Finally, using a spoon, drizzle Blue Cheese atop the top burger and apply the top bun-half!\n Step 11: Tip: This will be a messy one. Try stabbing a toothpick or shish kabob stick through the middle of the burger to hold the ingredients in place. Or, secure the entirety of the burger in your hand with a paper towel and eat it like that. If it the tower falls, use a fork (or your hands) and eat it piece by piece."
